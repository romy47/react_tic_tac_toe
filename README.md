# Tic Tac Toe Game with React

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React and styled using Bootstrap. It was developed as part of a course I am taking on React and Next.js in Udemy, with additional tweaks and customizations. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
